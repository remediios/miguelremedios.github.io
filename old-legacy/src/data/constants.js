Rather than relying solely on traditional, often vulnerable methods like usernames and passwords, this project pioneers the use of biometric behavioral patterns as a more robust and user-friendly authentication mechanism. A research study is associated with this project where more details are documented on how a Logistic Regression Machine Learning model is used to perform intrusion detection.",
